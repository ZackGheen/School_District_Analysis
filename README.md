# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

the purpose of this Analysis was to inform the school board of how kewy metrics were changed affected in the wake of circumstances at Thomas High School. We had to perfrom redactions of all math and reading standardized test scores at the ninth grade level at Thomas High School and determine how these redactions affected key metrics realted to the district and performance measurements. 

##Results

The district as a whole was affected in a minimal way by the redaction of ninth grade scores at Thomas, the overall number of students that passed both math and reaing tests (70% or higher) only changed about .10 of a percentage point. however the percentage of students passing math went up almost a full percentage point.

Thomas High School itself was affected statistically by the removal of the scores. Scores in the following categories went from: (average math score:83.418349 to 83.418349)  	(average reading score: 83.848930 to 83.896082)	(% passing math:93.272171 to 93.185690)	(% passing reading:97.308869 to 97.019)	(% overall passing:90.948012 to 90.630324)

Even after replacing all scores at the 9th grade level Thomas still ranked near the top in the district in the three major academic statistics, being overall the second best performing school. 

replacing all the scores in 9th grade had a predictably bad affect on the 9th grade level stistics in Thomas High school, as they had no statistics to go off of. , 
scores by school spending were also relatively unaffected by the changes with math percentage, reading percentage, and overall percentage who are passing changing only .00, .80, and .07% resepctively. .

##Summary
 
  Overall it seems that the removal of the grades for Thomas High School ninth graders didn't have a statistically large impact on any of the key metrics for the school district. It is interesting to note that the math scores went up nearly an entire percentage point. Showing at least a correlation to the performance of Thomas High School students in the ninth grade being somehow stistically lower than the rest of the district.
